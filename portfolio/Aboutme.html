	<p>I am Charlie Brodkin, a 13 year old photographer.  I have loved taking pictures since I got my first camera at the age of 6. I would take pictures of my bed, food, toys, and much more.  I started to really get serious about photography at age 11.  Since then, I have developed my own unique style. I take macro photos, but not of your typical flowers and insects. I attempt to make art out of everyday objects.  I find that the world looks different to me than most other people. I see details that no one else seems to notice (for instance patterns in texture, color, and light). When I see these patterns, it is nearly impossible for me to resist photographing them. This feeling is the reason why I have pursued photography, and will continue taking photographs for a long time to come.</p>
